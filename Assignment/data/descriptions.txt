Ship
Is slow to both move and fire, but each bullet packs a punch! Real bang for your buck choice if lacking credits.

IFO
An Identified Flying Object, a nippy little assault option and a whole lot faster at shooting, has less health than a Ship however.

Lineman
Moves the battleline and provides 10secs of cover, making it useless for enemy towers to shoot you!

Bomber
Great choice for initial damage, however it only deals damage of half of a towers current health.
