Ship- Is slow to both move and fire, but each bullet packs a punch! 

IFO- An Identified Flying Object, a nippy little assault, has less health than a Ship however.

Lineman- Moves the battleline and provides 10secs of cover, making it useless for enemy towers to shoot you!

Bomber- Great choice for initial damage, however it only deals damage of half of a towers current health.
