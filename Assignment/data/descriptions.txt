Objective- You must destroy waves of towers with the options at your disposal. After the final tower of a lane has been destroyed you will capture that lane. Whoever has the most lanes by the end will win the game
Probe- These are sent out by enemy towers, their mission is to capture lanes! You must try and stop them by clicking on them! For each one you destroy you will earn credits
Credits- Credits can be spent on buying objects to help destroy towers.
ObjectMenu- Provides you with various options to help you destroy towers
Ship- Is slow to both move and fire, but each bullet packs a punch! 
IFO- An Identified Flying Object, a nippy little assault, has less health than a Ship however
Lineman- Moves the battleline and provides 10secs of cover, making it useless for enemy towers to shoot you!
Bomber- Great choice for initial damage, however it only deals damage of half of a towers current health.
Turret- Pretty basic tower, fire rate is not bad and can take a bit of damage. Only fires one bullet at a time
Mech- As scary as it sounds, devestating in attack and can take quite a few hits
Medusa- These guys are tough, in order to defeat them you must destroy both the towers that make up this fearsome foe! Also one bullet from this is instant destruction for any object unlucky to be in the same lane
Mothership- Final tower! You must destroy as many parts of it in order to capture as many lanes as you can
